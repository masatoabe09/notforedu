Worked

select count(JobID), count(UserID) from ScheduleUsers

select * from ScheduleMaster;

Delete from ScheduleMaster where UserID='Ryosuke.N'

------------------------------

Worked but seems strange


select count(*) from ScheduleMaster;

select count(UserID='Ryosuke.N'), count(EXIST='休') from ScheduleMaster

select count ScheduleMaster where UserID='Ryosuke.N'

------------------------------


Didn't work



SELECT カラム名 , ... FROM テーブル名 WHERE カラム IS NULL;
SELECT count(JobID) , ... FROM ScheduleUsers WHERE 作業有無 IS NULL;

select UserID as ユーザーＩＤ,EXIST as 作業有無 from ScheduleMaster where UserID='Ryosuke.N' and KEYDATE >= '2018-04-01' order by KEYDATE and WHERE EXIST IS NULL

select count(EXIST) from ScheduleUsers
